  <!-- relative postion means:An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal 
  position.Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned 
  element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position.
  Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element. -->
<!-- 
  An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned 
  ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed). -->

  <!-- An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays 
  in the same place even if the page is scrolled. 
  The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element. -->

  <!-- An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position. -->
