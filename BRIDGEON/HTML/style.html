    <p style="color: yellow; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px;">The `style` attribute in HTML enables inline CSS styling directly within an element's tag. It allows developers to specify CSS property-value pairs for individual elements. Inline styles are defined within double quotes and separated by semicolons. This approach is useful for making quick, specific styling changes to elements. However, it's generally recommended to use external stylesheets for broader styling needs to maintain code organization and scalability.</p>

    <p style="color: skyblue;text-align: justify;">HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, serves as the backbone of the web, providing the fundamental structure for creating web pages. At its core, HTML consists of a series of elements, each enclosed within opening and closing tags, which define different parts of the content. These elements range from basic components like headings, paragraphs, and links, to more complex structures such as forms, tables, and multimedia embeds.
        One of the key strengths of HTML lies in its simplicity and versatility. It allows developers to organize content hierarchically, with nested elements representing various levels of importance or relationship. Additionally, HTML provides semantic elements that convey the meaning and purpose of the content, improving accessibility and search engine optimization.
        HTML documents are rendered by web browsers, which interpret the markup and display the content accordingly. This makes HTML a universal language understood by all modern browsers, ensuring consistent rendering across different platforms and devices</p>
