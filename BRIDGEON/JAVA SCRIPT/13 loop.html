<!-- In JavaScript, a loop is a programming construct used to repeatedly execute a 
block of code until a certain condition is met. There are several types of loops available in JavaScript:

for loop: Executes a block of code a specified number of times.
while loop: Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
do...while loop: Similar to a while loop, but guarantees that the block of code is executed at least once 
before checking the condition. -->
